    "#     1) An AI incident is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly leads to any of the following harms: (a) injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people; (b) disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; (c) violations to human rights or a breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights; (d) harm to property, communities or the environment.' The harm can be physical, psychological, reputational, economic/financial (including harm to property), environmental, public interest (e.g., protection of critical infrastructure and democratic institutions), human rights and fundamental rights. \n",
    "#     2) An AI risk is expressed as likelihood that harm or damage will occur. Risk is a function of both the probability of an event occurring and the severity of the consequences that would result. Risk is usually expressed in terms of risk sources, potential events, their consequences and their likelihood.  \"\"\" },\n",

If the risk includes specific info which cannot be found in the model/use description, then do not impose the specificity on the adapted risk. Pay attention to the model_task. If the risk could not emanate from this type of model, do not adapt this risk.\n",

The harm can be physical, psychological, reputational, economic/financial (including harm to property), environmental, public interest (e.g., protection of critical infrastructure and democratic institutions), human rights and fundamental rights. \\n    2) An AI risk is expressed as likelihood that harm or damage will occur. Risk is a function of both the probability of an event occurring and the severity of the consequences that would result. Risk is usually expressed in terms of risk sources, potential events, their consequences and their likelihood.  \"},\n",

Output the risk ONLY AFTER ADAPTING IT TO THE USE. If some risks are redundant and similar to each other, skip the duplicates and rephrase ONLY UNIQUE risks. If some risks do not pertain to the model description or use, skip those. DO NOT INVENT ANY NEW RISKS. \\n Guidelines:\\n 1. Understand Model Description, Model Task and Use: Thoroughly read and understand the specific context of the AI model being described, the task it is intended for and its application described in use.\\n 2. Identify Relevant Risks: There are two lists of risks. Identify unique risks from both lists that are relevant to the described model and use; skip those that are not. Remember the source of the risk. For the model_risks, check if it is relevant to the model description and model_task. If it is not, skip those. For the aiid_risks, check if it is relevant to the model_task and use. Skip those, if it is not relevant.\\n 3. Adapt Each Risk: Adapt each identified risk to the context of the model and use, ensuring it aligns with the specifics of the use. If the risk includes specific info which cannot be found in the model/use description, then do not impose the specificity on the adapted risk. Pay attention to the model_task. If the risk could not emanate from this type of model, do not adapt this risk.\\n 4. Format and Clarity: Verb + Object + [Explanation]. Start with an action verb in active present tense (e.g., undermines, discriminates, infringes, reduces, increases, underperforms, etc.). Be clear, and to-the-point, with a maximum of 20 words.\\n 5. Identify the subject at risk: For each adapted risk, identify the subject at risk from the list - AI user, AI subject and institutions and environment. Both AI user and AI subject should be taken from the use in input where as the institutions and environment are in general.\\n \\n Examples of Good Adaptation: \\n 1. The use description involves a facial recognition system.\\n    Reference Risk: Violates privacy rights.\\n    Adapted Risk: Undermines the right to privacy if the facial recognition data is not properly secured.\\n    Reasoning: Specifies how the privacy violation pertains to the facial recognition data. \\n 2. The model description involves a model fine-tuned on Western zodiac signs,\\n    Reference Risk: Overfits heavily due to training on a very small corpus.\\n    Adapted Risk: Overfits heavily due to fine-tuning on a small corpus of Western zodiac signs data.\\n    Reasoning: Specifies the small corpus context of Western zodiac signs.\\n\\n Examples of Bad Adaptation:\\n 1. The use description involves a model fine-tuned on Twitter dataset\\n    Reference Risk: Produces harmful content such as conspiracist views.\\n    Bad Adaptation: Generates harmful conspiratorial content.\\n    Good Adaptation: Produces harmful content such as conspiracist views common in Twitter data.\\n    Reasoning: The good adaptation specifies the source of the harmful content, aligning it with the Twitter data context.\\n 2. The use description involves a educational use case and model task is image classification\\n    Reference Risk: Underperforms due to limited genuine samples for Arabic.\\n    Bad Adaptation: Underperforms with educational content in Arabic due to limited data.\\n    Reasoning: This risk needs to be skipped as the model does not have anything to do with Arabic\\n \\nOutput Format: Ensure your output strictly follows this JSON structure.\\n\\n{\\n    \"cardID\": \"<Card ID>\",\\n    \"use\": \"<use>\"\\n    \"risks\": \\n    {\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \"reference_risk\": \"Reference risk 1 from list\",\\n                \"source\": \"model_risks or aiid_risks\",\\n                \"adapted_risk\": \"Unique risk 1 adapted\",\\n                \"reasoning\": \"reasoning\",\\n                \"subject_at_risk\": \"AI user or AI subject or Institution and Environment\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \"reference_risk\": \"Reference risk 2 from list\",\\n                \"source\": \"model_risks or aiid_risks\",\\n                \"adapted_risk\": \"Unique risk 2 adapted\",\\n                \"reasoning\": \"reasoning\",\\n                \"subject_at_risk\": \"\"AI user or AI subject or Institution and Environment\"\\n            },\\n            ...\\n        ]\\n    },\\n}\\n\\n\\nImportant Notes: Do not report your reasoning steps or any preamble like \\'Here is the output\\', \\'```json ...```\\', ONLY the JSON result.

    "    1) An AI incident is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly leads to any of the following harms: (a) injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people; (b) disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; (c) violations to human rights or a breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights; (d) harm to property, communities or the environment.' The harm can be physical, psychological, reputational, economic/financial (including harm to property), environmental, public interest (e.g., protection of critical infrastructure and democratic institutions), human rights and fundamental rights. \n",
    "    2) An AI risk is expressed as likelihood that harm or damage will occur. Risk is a function of both the probability of an event occurring and the severity of the consequences that would result. Risk is usually expressed in terms of risk sources, potential events, their consequences and their likelihood.  \"\"\" },\n",

    " 2. Identify Unique Risks: There are two lists of risks. Identify unique risks from both lists that are relevant to the described model; skip those that are not. Remember the source of the risk. For the model_risks, check if it is relevant to the model description and model_task. If it is not, skip those. For the aiid_risks, check if it is relevant to the model_task. Skip those, if it is not relevant.\n",

    "    Mitigation mapped: Probe these aspects on your use-cases to evaluate risks.\n",
